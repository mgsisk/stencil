## Reporting

Report security issues for this project to security@mgsisk.com with this
projects name in the subject line. Project maintainers will make every effort
to acknowledge, review, and address security issues as soon as possible.
Reporters will receive progress updates, and should work with project
maintainers as much as they are able to help address reported issues.

## Disclosure

any outstanding security issues. Project maintainers may choose to publicly
announce security issues in other venues, and will work with reporters to
determine an appropriate public response.
