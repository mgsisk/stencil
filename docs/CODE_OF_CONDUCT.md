# Code of Conduct

A primary goal of our community is to provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming
environment for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, experience,
gender, nationality, sexual orientation, race, religion, or socioeconomic
status. This code of conduct outlines expectations for everyone participating in
this community, as well as consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite
everyone participating in this community to help us create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.

## Behavior

- Publishing or threatening to publish personally identifying information
- Sexual advances, imagery, or language
- Violent imagery, language, or threats of violence

## Consequences

Community leaders should issue a fair and suitable response to behavior deemed
harmful, inappropriate, or unacceptable. In any response, community leaders
should provide clarity of violation and potential consequences of continued
behavior to the individual(s) involved.

Examples of responses to code of conduct violations include:

- Nothing, if community leaders determine no code of conduct violation occurred
- Public or private reprimand
- Request for public or private apology from the individual(s) involved
- Voluntary, temporary, or permanent ban from some or all community spaces
