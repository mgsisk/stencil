## [Docs][]

If you don't know where to start, start with the documentation. The docs explain
how the project works.

## [Issues][]

If you've found a bug or want to suggest a new feature, you should file an
issue. Issues are for discussing specific items that can be assigned to a
contributor, organized with labels, and grouped into milestones to help drive
development.

## [Contact][]

If all else fails, you can try contacting the project maintainer directly. A
response isn't gauranteed, but the maintainer does their best to answer
questions as they can.
