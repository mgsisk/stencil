> Documents project support resources.

## [Docs][]

If you don't know where to start, start with the documentation. The docs explain
how the project works, and should help answer common questions.

## [Issues][]

If you've found a bug or want to suggest a new feature, file an issue. Issues
are for discussing specific items that can be organized with labels, assigned to
a contributor, and grouped into milestones to help drive development.

## [Contact][]

If all else fails, you can try contacting the project maintainer. A response
isn't gauranteed, but the maintainer does their best to answer questions as they
can.
